Scenario [From First Assignment]
Safety Boss Limited (SBL) is a medium-sized company specializing in job safety products e.g. PPE (Hard
Hats, Safety Boots etc), harnesses, jobsite lighting etc. It was founded in 2012 and has grown steadily
over the years, becoming one of the most dominant businesses in its sector. Currently SBL supplies
more than 150 businesses throughout Trinidad & Tobago. The company has been exceptionally
successful for many years but is now facing a number of new challenges, never before experienced.

SBL finds itself facing stiff competition from a number of rival companies which have expanded into
e-commerce and ventured onto the worldwide web. These rivals have for some time been targeting
portions of the market sought after by SBL but are also seeking to expand into other markets
segments not previously considered by SBL as they were not previously accessible by virtue of their
geographical locations (SBL did not have a physical presence in those locations). These areas include
markets in other Caribbean territories.

Due to these, and a number of other factors, SBL has been experiencing a steady decline in overall
profits within recent years. A new Director has been appointed and has proposed a revamped
business strategy which attempts to “digitize and modernize” the company. In a recent meeting the
CEO placed specific emphasis on the following key points:

• There is a need to increase business customer awareness of the company, its brands and
products/services.
• There is a need to engage with business customers in a more direct and personal manner.
The company must be able to engage with customers to:

⎯ Determine Customer wants and needs regarding the range and type of
products/services (do they have current wants and needs that are not being met by
products/services found within the existing catalogue);
⎯ Identify Customer preferences regarding the features, functions and quality of
existing or future products/services;
⎯ Determine Customer satisfaction levels regarding existing products/services,
service/order fulfillment and/or website.
⎯ Provide more personalised recommendations of available products/services that may
be of interest.

• SBL must then innovate where needed to provide products/services in the manner desired
by the customers. Generally, SBL needs to improve communication and information
exchange with its customers and internal organizational stakeholders.
• SBL must increase sales, revenue, customer retention, customer satisfaction and repeat
business, expand the customer base and, if possible, reduce/minimize operating costs.

The focus of the strategy proposed by the Director is to establish and develop an online presence in
order to maintain its competitive position. Safety Boss Limited is to adopt a “click and mortar”
business model instead of the pure “brick and mortar” model that they have been utilizing since its
inception.
They have chosen to outsource the design and build of the website and subsequently forwarded a
request for proposal (RfP) to potential suppliers. Following the review of the responses to the RFP,
